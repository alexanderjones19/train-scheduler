# train-scheduler

Enter the parameters for the train that you will be logging and watch as the application tells you when the next train will be and how many minutes away it is. Add as many trains as you like!

This train scheduler is programmed using javascript and jQuery. The storage of data is handled using Google Firebase, and the time aspects are handled using momentJS.
